The contents of the new file "__screenshots/template_name.png" will be an image file in PNG format. The image should visually represent the design and layout of the 404 page for the new template.

Please note that as an AI text-based model, I am unable to directly create or modify image files. You will need to manually create the screenshot image and add it to the specified directory in the repository.
